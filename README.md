#  House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains my solution attempt for the [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal is to predict the final sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa using regression-based models.

##  Learning Reference

This project was based on the YouTube tutorial by **Computer Science**:  
🔗 [Kaggle House Prices - Python Data Science Project | Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV03sQ0srcU)

I used this tutorial as a guide to learn data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model pipeline building.  
The code has been adapted and modified to deepen my understanding of the Kaggle workflow.

##  Objective

Build a regression model to predict house sale prices as accurately as possible, using various data cleaning and modeling techniques.

---

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn 
- XGBoost



---

##  Evaluation Metric

- Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) — as used by Kaggle

---

##  Data Usage

Due to Kaggle’s rules, datasets are not included in this repo.  
You can download them from the [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) or using the Kaggle API.
